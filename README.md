im building an arduino based
desoldering gun controller owing to the fact i bought the gun without a base station very cheap.

2 Mosfets
heatsink to fit mosfets
30mm 5v cooling fan
5 1k resistors
470uF 35v elecotrolytic capacitor
car tyre inflator pump (12v emergency inflatorkit type) modified to be vacuum pump
