# Desoldering-Gun
Arduino Based Desoldering Gun   

Im building an arduino based desoldering gun controller owing to the fact I bought the gun without a base station very cheap. 
Currently its pretty dumb but functional. 
Plans include adding lcd and rotary encode for temp control

Arduino Nano

RS Pro Desoldering Gun

2 Mosfets

heatsink to fit mosfets

30mm 5v cooling fan

6 1k resistors (values arent important being used for pullup and gate-drain along with io protection)

470uF 35v elecotrolytic capacitor

car tyre inflator pump (12v emergency inflator kit type taken from a scrap peugeot car) modified to be vacuum pump modifications depend on your particular pump but you need to remove valving from pump and add a pair of check valves

2 aquarium check valves

3d printed valve block
