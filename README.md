# Desoldering-Gun
Arduino Based Desoldering Gun   

im building an arduino based
desoldering gun controller owing to the fact I bought the gun without a base station very cheap. 
currently its pretty dumb but functional. 
Plans include adding lcd and rotary encode for temp control

#Current BOM

Arduino Nano

RS Pro Desoldering Gun

2 Mosfets

heatsink to fit mosfets

30mm 5v cooling fan

5 1k resistors

470uF 35v elecotrolytic capacitor

car tyre inflator pump (12v emergency inflatorkit type taken from a scrap peugeot car) modified to be vacuum pump modifications depend on your particular pump but you need to remove valving from pump and add a pair of check valves
